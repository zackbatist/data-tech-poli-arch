description: Ideas and notes for the data-tech-poli-arch paper.
date: last-modified
---

- On data management as management
- On the distribution of materials within a project among specialists, and how it neatly aligns with database models
- Sampling strategies as a means of controlling the objects, while also reliant on strict distribution of labour
- And implicit recognition that this is not enough: need to bring in consultants to share "being there" perspectives

- The rejected JEP abstract has some good language I can borrow.

- explosion paper
  - About the explosion and integration of specialist work.
  - How this work relies on both robust and relaxed means of communication and control.
  - Division of the site
  - Sampling strategies
  - Integrating and aligning perspectives
  - Informal consultation

- See also the excerpt from the draft Information Matters paper, on the role of fieldworkers in preparing samples for lithics specialists to review

- Some bits from roles-agency paper, scaffolding paper

- project and data management paper seems like something that got broken apart into various other drafts

About systems of control --- over behaviour, materials and information.
About the utility of these control mechanisms, the apprehensions surrounding it, and healthy vs unhealthy modes of control.
